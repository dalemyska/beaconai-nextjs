# Backlink Strategy: Building Authority from 4 to 100+ Backlinks

**Current State:** 4 backlinks from 2 referring domains
**90-Day Goal:** 25+ high-quality backlinks from 15+ referring domains
**180-Day Goal:** 50+ backlinks from 30+ referring domains

## Why Backlinks Matter

For beaconai.ai, backlinks serve three purposes:
1. **SEO Authority:** Google uses backlinks as votes of confidence
2. **Referral Traffic:** Quality backlinks send targeted visitors
3. **Credibility:** Being cited by authoritative sources builds trust

Current domain authority is low. With strategic backlink building, we can compete for rankings faster.
